/*
		A class that creates a simple Safari-like Preferences window with a
		toolbar at the top.
		
		UKPrefsPanel is ridiculously easy to use: Create a tabless NSTabView,
		where the name of each tab is the name for the toolbar item, and the
		identifier of each tab is the identifier to be used for the toolbar
		item to represent it. Then create image files with the identifier as
		their names to be used as icons in the toolbar.
	
		Finally, drag UKPrefsPanel.h into the NIB with the NSTabView,
		instantiate a UKPrefsPanel and connect its tabView outlet to your
		NSTabView. When you open the window, the UKPrefsPanel will
		automatically add a toolbar to the window with all tabs represented by
		a toolbar item, and clicking an item will switch between the tab view's
		items.
